# Spectral_Inference_for_High_Dimensional_Time_Series
# Simulation Study on Gaussian Approximation and Resampling Methods

This repository contains R code for the simulation study conducted in Spectral Inference for High Dimensional Time Series, which evaluates the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation results and assesses the performance of two resampling methods for real data analysis:
- Gaussian multiplier resampling
- Subsampling
