# Simulation Study on Gaussian Approximation and Resampling Methods

This repository contains R code for the simulation study conducted in Spectral Inference for High Dimensional Time Series, which evaluates the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation results and assesses the performance of two resampling methods for real data analysis:
- Gaussian multiplier resampling
- Subsampling

The study investigates:
- The accuracy of Gaussian approximation in high-dimensional settings.
- The empirical performance of Gaussian multiplier resampling.
- The performance of the proposed subsampling method for real data applications.

# Repository Structure
